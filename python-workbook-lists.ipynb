    "A line of best fit is a straight line that best approximates a collection of n data points. In this exercise, we will assume that each point in the collection has an x coordinate and a y coordinate. The symbols x ̄ and y ̄ are used to represent the average x value in the collection and the average y value in the collection respectively. The line of best fit is represented by the equation y = mx + b where m and b are calculated usingthe following formulas: ![Screenshot%202024-02-26%20at%2010.24.36%E2%80%AFPM.png](attachment:Screenshot%202024-02-26%20at%2010.24.36%E2%80%AFPM.png)\n",
    "Write a program that reads a collection of points from the user. The user will enter the x part of the first coordinate on its own line, followed by the y part of the first coordinate on its own line. Allow the user to continue entering coordinates, with the x and y parts each entered on their own line, until your program reads a blank line for the x coordinate. Display the formula for the line of best fit in the form y = m x + b by replacing m and b with the values you calculated using the preceding formulas. For example, if the user inputs the coordinates (1, 1), (2, 2.1) and (3, 2.9) then your program should display y = 0.95x + 0.1."

    "the values are 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace.\n",
    "Each playing card can be represented using two characters. The first character is the value of the card, with the values 2 through 9 being represented directly. The characters “T”, “J”, “Q”, “K” and “A” are used to represent the values 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace respectively. The second character is used to represent the suit of the card. It is normally a lowercase letter: “s” for spades, “h” for hearts, “d” for diamonds and “c” for clubs. The following table provides several examples of cards and their two-character representations.\n",

    "Write a second function named shuffle that randomizes the order of the cards in a list. One technique that can be used to shuffle the cards is to visit each element in the list and swap it with another random element in the list. You must write your own loop for shuffling the cards. You cannot make use of Python’s built-in shuffle function.<br/>\n",
    "Use both of the functions described in the previous paragraphs to create a main program that displays a deck of cards before and after it has been shuffled. Ensure that your main program only runs when your functions have not been imported into another file."

Write a function, deal, which takes the number of hands, the number of cards per hand, and a deck of cards as its three parameters. Your function should return a list containing all of the hands that were dealt. Each hand will be represented as a list of cards.<br/>\n",

    "When dealing the hands, your function should modify the deck of cards passed to it as a parameter, removing each card from the deck as it is added to a player’s hand.

Your function should follow this custom when constructing the hands for the players.<br/>\n",

Your function will take three parameters: the list, the minimum value and the maximum value. It will return an integer result greater than or equal to 0.
